"""The form a timestamp takes between an agent and the control plane.

An agent and the plane it talks to are upgraded at different times, so
what one writes the other has to read -- including the agent that has
not been upgraded yet. These spell out both halves of that, because the
form is decided by RESTAlchemy and changed once already: 16.0.0 writes a
timestamp landing on a whole second as `...:56Z`, where 15.x wrote
`...:56.000000Z`, and 15.x cannot read what 16 writes.
