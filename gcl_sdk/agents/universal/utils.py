    Each item in ``target_fields`` is either a plain top-level key
    (``"setter"``), which selects the whole value under that key, or a
    dot-separated path (``"setter.kind"``), which selects only that
    nested key. A path descends through dicts and through every element
    of a list, so ``setter.profiles.profile`` selects ``"profile"``
    inside each dict of the ``setter.profiles`` list::

    ``element`` and ``note`` are outside the declared paths, so a default
    the data plane fills in there cannot keep the hashes apart.

    Rules:

    - a plain key wins over dotted paths with the same head: ``"setter"``
      together with ``"setter.kind"`` keeps the whole ``"setter"`` value;
    - a list element that is not a dict cannot take the rest of a path
      and is dropped from the resulting list;
    - a key missing on the way down is skipped -- a nested object
      legitimately may not have every possible sub-field set;
    - if ``strict`` is True (default), a missing plain top-level key
      raises ``KeyError``, matching the plain dict-comprehension filter
      this replaces. Dotted paths never raise;
    - a field that is empty or has an empty segment (``"setter."``,
      ``".x"``, ``"a..b"``) raises ``ValueError``: such a path silently
      selects nothing or an empty dict, which diverges the hashes
      without a clue as to why.

    Applying the very same paths to the target and to the actual resource
    keeps their hashes symmetric, which is what lets a resource settle.
